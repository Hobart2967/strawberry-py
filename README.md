# strawberry-py

This framework is work in progress.

Aim is to avoid boilerplate WSGI layers when deploying python lambdas with multiple endpoints. 
Frameworks like python-flask, connexion and others require developers to add an annoying wsgi layer on top of their api.
This casues the package to get bigger and bigger while also increasing the cold start times and runtime duration of a lambda.

## Support
- Supports Python 3.7 and higher
- Supports AWS Lambda
- Should support other Lambda function providers with small adjustments.
- Comes with an OpenApi Generator for easing documentation of REST APIs âœ¨

```
from strawberry_py import ControllerHandler, AwsLambdaRequest, AwsLambdaResponse

#region Controllers
from .controllers.hello_world_controller import HelloWorldController
#endregion

def handler(event, context):
  request = AwsLambdaRequest(event, context)
  controller_handler = ControllerHandler.get_instance()
  response = controller_handler.handleRequest(request)

  return AwsLambdaResponse.from_response(response).get_lambda_result()
 ```
